React Authentication Example
This is an example application I created to showcase how to implement authentication on a web application using React and react-router on the frontend and node.js, express, mongodb, and mongoose on the backend.

The associated blog post for this example can be found here.

To run the application first clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/faizanv/react-auth-example.git
Install the dependencies

npm install
Make sure that MongoDB is running

mongod
run the server

npm run server
and then in a separate window/tab run the frontend

npm start
The application should be running at http://localhost:3000/

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can find the most recent version of their guide here.
